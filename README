Computer Graphics Practical I

I have succesfully implemented:
* perspective projection
* object translation
* z-buffering
* triangle rasterization (with barycentric coordinates)
* flat shading
* Gouraud shading
* Phong shading

For the barycentric coordinate calculations I followed the guide at:
http://www.cs.caltech.edu/courses/cs171/barycentric.pdf
as suggested in the practical description.

I used the lecture notes and Wikipedia (occasionally) to figure out the shading and the z-buffer stuff.
